Hello. I'm devilish_d20, a crappy bot for playing D&D.
I take commands that start with @, and are separated with slashes ('/').
Example: @attack/aboleth.

Help topics ("@help/[topic]"):
- commands: What commands can you use with me?
- dmcommands: What aren't you lowly players allowed to do?
- source: Where do I come from?
